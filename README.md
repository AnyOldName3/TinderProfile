# TinderProfile
I don't edit my own Tinder profile because I find the idea terrifying. A GitHub repo lets others do the scary bit for me.

This can only be used when profile.txt contains fewer than 500 characters. Unfortunately I can't figure out how to set up Travis CI to check for this on incoming PRs.
