# TinderProfile
I don't edit my own Tinder profile because I find the idea terrifying. A GitHub repo lets others do the scary bit for me.

This can only be used when profile.txt contains fewer than 500 characters. This is checked by Travis CI automatically.

Master branch status:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AnyOldName3/TinderProfile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AnyOldName3/TinderProfile)

By the way, if anyone happens to want to make this superfluous (e.g. by falling in love with me so I don't need Tinder) then feel free to let me know - it's not like I'm socially aware enough to realise or capable of being forward enough to do anything about it without help.
